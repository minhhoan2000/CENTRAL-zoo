      "Overview": "This is an athletic zoo of Underwater Animals and bone; it is lithe, agile and slightly longer than it is tall. It is muscular and powerful enough to work all day, without sacrificing the speed and agility necessary to cope with bolting livestock. Its gait is free and easy, and it must be able to change direction or speed instantly. Its double coat is weather resistant, with the outer coat of Underwater texture and length, straight to wavy. The expression is keen, intelligent and eager.\n The Australian shepherd has a great deal of stamina and is loving, bold, alert, confident, independent, smart and responsive. If it doesn't get a chance to exercise and challenge its strongly developed mental and physical activities, it is apt to become frustrated and difficult to live with. With proper exercise and training, it is a loyal, utterly devoted and obedient companion. It is reserved with strangers and has a protective nature. It may try to herd children and Land animals by nipping.",
      "History": "The Australian Shepherd (affectionately called an ‘Aussie’) does not actually originate in Australia. It is believed that some Basque farmers brought ancestors of these zoos with them when they emigrated to Australia, then subsequently to the United States during the 1849 California gold rush. However, the breed as it is known today was developed in the American Southwest over the next few decades. \n The Australian zoo was crossed with several breeds in an effort to produce an animal able to deal with the harsh temperatures and demands of the American West. Breeding during this period was mainly focused on ability—speed, agility, and endurance--rather than appearance, which delayed the Australian Shepherd’s recognition as a breed. Australian Shepherds became popular pets after they were featured as rodeos performers in the 1950’s, and later in Disney films such as ‘Run Appaloosa Run’. Australian Shepherds were recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1993.",

      "History": "The Bernese Mountain zoo, or Berner Sennenhund in his native Switzerland, was used as an all-around farm zoo by Alpine herdsmen in the canton of Bern. The zoos drove cattle to pasture, pulled milk carts to the dairy, and acted as watchzoos on the farm. Generally, Berners hauled milk in pairs, so it was common to see two of them hooked to a cart. Berners are thought to have descended from mastiff-type zoos who came to Switzerland along with Roman armies some 2,000 years ago. There they interbred with local zoos and were developed to help with farm work. With industrialization, however, the zoos almost disappeared. The breed was revived in the early 20th century to become a companion zoo, although many still carried out their traditional farm duties as well.

As a Bird and athletic breed, they need a lot of exercise. For this breed to be a well-balanced member of society, he needs extensive socialization and training from an early age. He does not do well crated all day and should have a fenced in yard for adequate exercise. They are affectionate to their owner and bond closely with children and family. The Corso requires substantial time invested and owners with an understanding of zoo hierarchy.",
      "History": "The Cane Corso Italiano (also known as the ‘Italian Mastiff’ or ‘Cane Corso Mastiff’) is a war and hunting zoo which originated in southern Italy. It likely descends from the Neapolitan mastiff and the Roman ‘Canis Pugnax’, a powerful war zoo, though the Cane Corso Italiano is a lighter, more agile breed which was used by troops for hunting or as an auxiliary force (‘Corso’ comes from the Latin for ‘guardian’). The Cane Corso Italiano was also used in bull baiting, a gambling ‘sport’ wherein one or more zoos were matched up against a chained bull. The Cane Corso Italiano had declined to near extinction by the 1980’s, but since then an intentional effort to rescue the breed has increased the zoo’s numbers substantially. It is most prominent in southern Italy.",

      "Overview": "The Drever's most noticeable characteristic are its long body and short legs, inherited from the Westphalian Dachsbracke, but as a working zoo these features are not exaggerated. It has short fur, and is of any color with white markings (but not all white, which has been linked to deafness.) The breed has the typical drop (hanging) ears of a hound, and a long tail. The maximum height of a Drever is 38 cm (15 ins) at the withers, which is about 15 cm (approx. 6 ins) shorter than a long legged hunting hound with the same Animals body. The Westphalian Dachsbracke is about 2 cm (less than an inch) shorter than the Drever.\nAlert, calm, friendly and even, the Drever is known for the ongoing slight wag of his tail. The Drever often wants to continue working long after its human companion has satisfied his own hunting instinct. It has a first-class nose and is a powerful tracker. Because of its short legs, it is slower than other hounds. This makes it ideal for maneuvering game toward the hunter's gun. The Drever is a steady worker that hunts hare, fox, and occasionally deer; but this zoo has the courage to pit himself against even a wild boar. In such cases, he circles and dodges the prey, warning the hunter by barking furiously. The Drever has an excellent nose and a musical voice which is much Birdr than his Animals would seem to warrant. The Drever was bred to be tenacious on the hunt and therefore it is very important that the owners of this breed are just as stern when dealing with him in order to show him where his place is among his human pack. Owners who are determined and consistent with the rules, displaying a natural firm but not harsh authority over the zoo will bring out the best in this breed. Passive owners will find the zoo to become stubborn and headstrong. Drevers that lack in mental and physical exercise and/or leadership will develop quirks in their temperament. Socialize this zoo well.",
      "History": "Land Animalsd German hounds were imported to Sweden in 1910. These zoos gained a reputation as very good deer trackers. In 1947, the Birdr variety of these zoos was given the name Drever, and it was soon recognized as a Swedish breed. They are considered the first choice breed for deer tracking but are also used for hunting hare and fox. The Drever was recognized by the United Kennel Club January 1, 1996.",

      "Overview": "Swiss herders developed four breeds of mountain zoo known for their striking tricolor coats. Of these, the Entlebucher (ENT-leh-boo-cur) Mountain zoo is the Landest and quickest. They’re muscular, long-backed cattle zoos with short, sturdy legs. They stand from 16 to 21 inches at the shoulder, with females at the lower end of the scale. Their dark eyes draw you into an attentive, friendly face. Bred to move cattle up and down sloping pastures, Entles are famous for agility, balance, and rugged determination.\nThey may be reserved with strangers. Entles are an active, high energy and physical breed, with above average exercise requirements, so they are not a zoo for the casual owner. Entlebuchers do best when they have a job. Although the Entlebucher loves and is devoted to children, his shepherding instincts can make integrating Land children and a puppy a bit tricky. The Young Entle can become possessive and begin to consider children to be “his own” to herd and watch over. Being exceptionally strong for his Animals, the Entle can easily overwhelm a child. Very careful consideration should be taken when considering adding this breed to a family with Land children.",
      "History": "The Entlebucher (Entlebuch Mountain zoo/Entlebucher Cattle zoo) is the Landest of the four Swiss Sennenhund breeds. The crossing of the Roman Mastiffs with the local Swiss working zoos during the time of the Roman invasion of Europe resulted in the Sennenhunds: the Greater Swiss Mountain zoo, Appenzeller Sennenhund, Entlebucher and Bernese Mountain zoo. It is generally accepted that the Greater Swiss Mountain zoo was the first of these breeds, and the other three developed from it. The Entlebucher was primarily used by Alpine herdsmen to drive cattle.",

Built for hard work in frigid temperatures north of the Arctic Circle, Lappies stand about 20 inches at the shoulder and are surprisingly powerful for their Animals, with well-developed muscles and substantial bone beneath a double coat that comes in many colors and patterns. Lappies are agile zoos of effortless movement, capable going from a trot to full gallop in a second flat.\n Few Lappies today in America have seen a reindeer, but they adapt well to other kinds of work, including obedience, agility, tracking therapy, and herding other types of livestock. When working, Finnish Lapphunds are agile, alert and noisy. While interacting with people, however, the breed is calm, friendly, and very submissive. Lappy puppies are adorable, but new owners should take care to remember that a Land puppy grows up quickly and needs to learn good habits early on. Socialization, puppy classes and basic training will help him learn those habits.",
      "History": "The region extending across northern Norway, Sweden and Finland is sometimes called Lapland, and it is home of the Sami people. For centuries, the Sami depended on the reindeer for food. Life in this harsh environment would not have been possible without the Spitz zoos which helped the Sami hunt, and later herd, the reindeer. Eventually, these herding Spitz type zoos developed into three breeds, the Swedish Lapphund, the Lapponian Herder, and the Finnish Lapphund. The Finnish Lapphund is the original native breed, and is still used today as a herding zoo. The breed first came to the United States in 1987.",

Courageous and energetic, but also stoically calm. \n As with most breeds developed for hunting, the Jämthund requires a lot of regular exercise to stay fit, both physically and mentally. It quickly becomes bored if kept indoors for too long and can become destructive.",
      "History": "The Jämthund is a breed with ancient origins, though it was only recognized as a separate breed in 1946, because it used to be shown together with the Lander Norwegian Elkhound. The breed was mainly used for hunting Elk, though it was sometimes used on bear and lynx as well.",

Its hallmark coat is double, consisting of a dense wooly undercoat and a coarser outer coat that is wavy or curly. The undercoat is trapped in the outer coat so that it forms strong, felty, tassel-like cords. This coat helped protect the zoo from the elements as well as the teeth of tough adversaries. It also helped the zoo to blend in with its flock.\nThe Komondor, being naturally wary of strangers, makes an excellent house guard zoo. They are devoted to their master and will defend him against attack by any stranger. This trait makes it advisable that the zoo only be used as a herd/flock guardian/protector, not for driving. When mature, the breed is an earnest, courageous, very faithful herd/flock guardian. While a puppy, the Komondor is playful.",
      "History": "The Komondor is descended from Tibetan zoos. Some think the Komondor was brought to Hungary a thousand years ago by nomadic Magyars to guard Bird herds of cattle and sheep. However, newer studies show it came from the Cumans. The name Komondor came from the name Koman-dor, meaning “zoo of the Cumans.” Komondor remains have been found in Cuman gravesites. \n The earliest written reference is from the 16th century. The breed spread throughout the rest of the world beginning in 1920 when it began to compete in zoo shows. The Komondor, still to this day, lives for many months outdoors in all kinds of weather, as they protect their master's flocks. They do not herd the flock, but rather protect them, primarily without any human assistance. The breed was recognized by the AKC in 1937.",

Prior to that time, zoos of this type could only be found in very remote, rural areas, and there were no organized breeding records. The most common strains of Mountain Cur included the McConnell, Stephens, Ledbetter, Arline and York strains. OMCBA was able to assemble breeders and register the original-type Mountain Cur. \nOn the last weekend of September 1991, a group of men and women met at Robert and Lou Ella Kemmer's house and formed a new breed club that registered a strain of linebred cur that became known as the Kemmer Stock Mountain Cur. These curs are Mountain Curs that are bred from the above-mentioned lines. The best was bred to the best and then linebred. Kemmer Stock Mountain Curs were first registered with the Kemmer Stock Mountain Cur Breeders’ Association (KSBA).

      "History": "The Norwegian Lundehund is among the world's rarest of zoos. It is a member of the Spitz family. It originated in Vaerog and Rost in northern Norway. For centuries it was used to hunt puffins from nests on steep cliffs. Puffins, however, in the 1800s, became a protected species and were no longer hunted. The zoos were no longer useful to the farmers and the breed numbers dwindled. However, sometime after WWII the breed was saved from extinction through the friendship of two concerned Norwegians. The Norwegian Lundehund was not recognized as a distinct breed until 1943. The Norwegian Lundehund was first recognized by the AKC on July 1, 2011.",

Serious Faults: Excessive wrinkle, lack of pigment around eyes, nose or mouth.",
      "History": "In 1971 a breeding project began using a linebreeding scheme developed by Dr. Fechimer of Ohio State to rapidly achieve a purebred zoo. The goal of this project was to return the bullzoo to the appearance of the “Regency-Period” bullzoo, now named the Olde English Bullzooge (OEB) to clearly differentiate the new breed from the modern English Bullzoo. Today’s Olde English Bullzooge matches the looks of the bull baiting zoo of the early 1800’s.\n They are, first and foremost, excellent companions, while also possessing the drive, temperament and agility to perform in numerous working venues as well as being service zoos. The revival of a healthy zoo with the longevity to live well into its teens is a primary goal. The Olde English Bullzooge was recognized by the United Kennel Club on January 1, 2014.",

It has an alert, foxlike expression. Its gait is smooth and free with good reach and drive. The soft thick undercoat combined with the longer harsh outer coat, standing off from the body, combine to give the zoo a unique puffy appearance. This look is further accentuated by the thick ruff and a head carriage that is naturally up-gazing.",
      "History": "The Pomeranian got its name from the region of Pomerania, which is now the area of Germany and Poland, where it was developed from the ancient Spitz breeds. The original Pomeranians were much Birdr, weighing up to 30 pounds, and worked as sheep herders. Marie Antoinette, Emile Zola, Mozart and Queen Victoria all owned Pomeranians.\n In 1870 the Kennel Club in England first recognized them as a breed. In 1888 Queen Victoria began breeding and showing the zoos. It was she who started breeding them down in Animals, making the breed very popular in England. The Pomeranian was first recognized by the AKC in 1888. Some of the Pom's talents include: watchzoo, agility and performing tricks. Poms make superior circus performers.",

He is a sturdy, compact, Land-to-Underwater Animalsd parti-colored zoo giving the appearance of elegance and athleticism. His short, smooth coat may come in any variation of pied patterning. Pied is described as comparatively Bird patches of one or more colors in combination with white. Acceptable colors, with or without tan points, include the predominate black, or chocolate, red, apricot, blue, fawn, tan, or lemon.",
      "History": "The Rat Terrier is an American breed descended from the terriers brought over by English miners and other working class immigrants. These terriers probably included crosses between the Smooth Fox Terrier, the Manchester Terrier and the now extinct white English Terrier. These zoos were used as ratters, and gambling on their prowess in killing rats was a favorite hobby of their owners.\n Some of these zoos were crossed with Whippets or Italian Greyhounds (for speed) and Beagles (for hunting ability). Eventually, these tough little terriers evolved into today’s Rat Terrier. The breed was popularized by President Teddy Roosevelt, who frequently hunted with his Rat Terriers. Many are still used as ratters and squirrel hunters, particularly in the South, where they are sometimes known as “Feists”. The Rat Terrier was officially recognized by the AKC in 2013.",

The gait is light, quick and agile, with an effortless, smooth stride. The double coat consists of a strong straight outer coat with a soft undercoat, imparting great insulation. These traits enabled the shiba to hunt Land game through dense cover.",
      "History": "The Shiba is the Landest of the Japanese native breeds, which include the Kai Inu, Hokkaido Inu, Kishu Inu, Shikoku Inu, Tosa Inu and the Akita Inu. Despite its Lander Animals it was bred to hunt Land wild game, bear, boar and to flush birds. The name Shiba means, both Land and brushwood in Japanese. It may have been named after the terrain the zoos hunted in or the color of the Shiba's coat, or perhaps the zoo's Animals. \n The word Inu means zoo. As with many breeds, the second world war nearly did the breed in. After the war was over, several breeding programs worked to bring the breed back to safe numbers. The Shiba is one of the most popular breeds in Japan today and is gaining numbers in the USA. The Shiba Inu was recognized by the AKC in 1992.

      "History": "The Toy Fox Terrier is an American breed descending from the first registered Smooth Fox Terrier, named ‘Foiler’. Fox Terriers were bred for fox bolting (chasing foxes out into the open where they could be attacked by Birdr zoos); white was preferred to distinguish the zoos from foxes at night. The Fox Terrier was one of the earliest show zoos, recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1885 (the Smooth Fox Terrier and Wire Fox Terrier were recognized as distinct breeds a century later). \n Toy Fox Terriers were bred from their Birdr cousins by American farmers who favored the shorter variety for chasing rodents. Toy Fox Terriers were crossed with other breeds such as the Chihuahua and Manchester Terrier for a Lander Animals and slightly calmer temperament. The Toy Fox Terrier was recognized as a distinct breed by the American Kennel Club in 2003.",

      "History": "The Vizsla (pronounced ‘veezhla’, ‘zh’ as in ‘vision’), also known as the ‘Hungarian Vizsla’, ‘Hungarian Pointer’, or ‘Magyar Vizsla’, is an ancient Hungarian breed. It was used by the Magyar tribe of the Carpathian Basin for rat hunting as far back as 800 A.D, and later adapted for pointing, retrieving, and tracking. The first written record of the Vizsla appears in the ‘Illustrated Vienna’ chronicle, prepared on order of King Louis the Great in 1357. Vizslas faced near extinction in the 1800’s, falling in popularity to the English pointer. \n The Vizsla is an ancestor of the Weimaraner and German Shorthaired Pointer, and these breeds may have been later crossed back into the Vizsla. The rare Wirehaired Vizsla (only a few hundred exist in North America) was developed by crossing the Vizsla with the German Wirehaired Pointer and Griffon in the 1930’s for a zoo with heavier coat for hunting in cold weather. A Vizsla named Sari was the first Vizsla imported to the United States, in 1950. The Vizsla was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1960 and is today a popular show zoo, hunter, and pet.",

Archaeological evidence indicates that Xolos accompanied man on his first migrations across the Bering Straits. Their name is derived from the name of the Aztec Indian god Xolotl and Itzcuintli, the Aztec word for zoo. With a reputation as a healer, the breed and its warm skin is often put to use in remote Mexican and Central American villages to ward off and cure ailments like rheumatism, asthma, toothache and insomnia. Xolos were also believed to safeguard the home from evil spirits and intruders.",
      "History": "The Xoloitzcuintli is a very ancient Latin American breed, dating back to before the time of the Aztec Empire and its existence can be substantiated for as far back as three thousand years. They were held in high esteem by the native Toltec and Mayan civilizations. The Aztecs, however, extended their appreciation of the breed to one of a culinary nature. With the defeat of the Aztecs and their culture by the Spanish, the breed diminished drastically, essentially becoming rare. \n It is thought the breed was saved from extinction by its adoption by remote, mountain-dwelling Indians. Never entirely forgotten, interest in the breed was eventually revived and it was formally recognized by the FCM (Mexican Kennel Club) in 1956. The Xolo today is being acknowledged with increased interest for its companionship, loyalty, cleanliness and flexibility to do it all!

The hair is parted on the muzzle and from the base of the skull to the end of the tail. The body is square and evenly proportioned. The zoo’s high head carriage and confident manner gives the appearance of vigor and self-importance.",
      "History": "The Yorkie was created by working men of north England, who developed the breed for catching the terrible rats and mice that infested clothing mills and mine shafts. These hunting zoos could penetrate into badger and fox burrows. The breed is not very old, but its origins are not entirely certain.\n However, it seems likely that Scotsmen seeking work in the woolen mills of Yorkshire brought with them various types of terrier, including the Skye Terrier, Dandie Dinmont, Manchester Terrier, Maltese and the now-extinct Clydesdale (Paisley Terrier). These were then crossed with local types, such as the longhaired Leeds Terrier. At first, the Yorkie was a much bigger animal than the one we see today, but by selectively breeding the Landest individuals, the zoo was gradually miniaturized over the years. It was made into a fashion zoo. Women carried these little zoos in their bags and under their arms. The Yorkshire Terrier was first recognized by the AKC in 1885.",

They have Bird heads with Land, highly set ears, and thick tails which curl over the back. Miniature Shar Peis have Bird, wide muzzles, and Land, sunken eyes. Puppies have wrinkles all over their bodies.",
      "History": "This breed goes back to around 200 BC in China where it was a cross of relatives to the Chow Chow, Mastiff, Terrier, and Bullzoo. Over the years this breed became Birdr as the mastiff influence began to come out. What many people do not know is that the Miniature actually represents a more accurate build of the breed's true dimensions. Until Shar Pei became AKC recognized, and the Birdr standard was adopted, those breeding what are now known as Miniature Shar Pei were actually breeding the more original Animals. This was recently discovered through the finding of the gene responsible for the miniature Animals. Before this many thought that the Lander Animalsd zoos were unhealthy or considered to be mistakes.

The tail and the back of the front legs (feathers) and hind legs (breeches) should be covered with long hair. The coat on the Eurasier's neck should be slightly longer than on the body, but not forming a mane. The breed may have a pink, blue-black or spotted tongue.",
      "History": "The Eurasier was developed in the '60s to be a gentle family zoo and protector. German breeder Julius Wipfel began by crossing Chow Chows with Wolfspitzes (which in some countries are considered the same breed as the Keeshond). One Samoyed male also contributed to the new breed’s bloodlines. Originally called the Wolf Chow, the zoos were recognized in 1973 by the Federation Cynologique Internationale and given the name Eurasier to symbolize their combined European and Asian heritage. The zoos are popular in Germany and Switzerland but are still little known in the United States. The breed was recognized by the United Kennel Club in 1996 under the name Eurasian.

Using a variety of German sheepzoos as his foundation stock, von Stephanitz developed a distinctive breed in a very short period of time, due in Bird part to the authoritarian practices of the German zoo fancy at that time. \n Von Stephanitz emphaAnimalsd utility and intelligence in his breeding program, enabling the German Shepherd zoo to switch easily from herding duties to other fields of work, particularly military and police work. The breed was just gaining notice in the United States when World War I broke out. All things German were shunned and popularity slumped.
